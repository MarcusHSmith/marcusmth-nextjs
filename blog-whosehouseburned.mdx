# Building WhoseHouseBurned.com: A Friday Night Hackathon During LA Fires

When the Palisades and Altadena fires shut down Los Angeles, I found myself with an unexpected Friday night project. The result? [WhoseHouseBurned.com](https://www.whosehouseburned.com) - a real-time tracker of celebrity homes affected by the January 2025 fires.

## The Build Process

Armed with Cursor's AI agents and a clear mission, I set out to create a simple but effective platform. The site needed to be:

- Fast to build
- Easy to update
- Reliable for concerned residents and curious onlookers

Using Next.js and Vercel for deployment, I quickly had a working prototype. The development process was significantly accelerated by Cursor's AI agents, which helped me iterate through different designs and implementations rapidly.

## The Vercel Deploy Limit Saga

Here's a funny tidbit: I actually hit Vercel's free deployment limits during development! The combination of rapid iterations with Cursor's AI agents and my "deploy early, deploy often" approach meant I was pushing updates faster than I expected. It's probably the first time I've ever maxed out Vercel's generous free tier - a badge of honor, perhaps?

## Keeping It Current

The site maintains its relevance through a multi-pronged data collection approach:

1. Manual updates from Instagram and Twitter monitoring
2. Automated daily ChatGPT queries that:
   - Check existing site data
   - Scan for new information across the internet
   - Identify and update any differences

This automated differential update system ensures the information stays fresh with minimal manual intervention.

## Technical Stack

- Next.js for the frontend
- Vercel for hosting
- ChatGPT for automated data verification
- Custom scripts for social media monitoring
- Cursor AI agents for development assistance

## Looking Forward

What started as a Friday night hackathon has evolved into a useful resource for tracking the impact of the LA fires on residential areas. While the circumstances that prompted its creation are unfortunate, the project demonstrates how quickly we can deploy useful tools in response to emerging situations.

The site continues to serve as a central information hub, and the automated update system ensures it remains relevant as the situation evolves.

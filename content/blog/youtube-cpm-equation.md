# The YouTube CPM equation

![CPM Equation](images/equation_cpm.svg)

_*If you want to change a channel's earning the only other variable is "views"*_

## CPM

Earnings to a creator are calculated by `Views / 1000 * RPM` where **RPM** is the revenue per 1000 views. **CPM** is the cost per 1000 views to advertisers. `RPM + Google's Cut = CPM`. Both **RPM** and **CPM** are the visible in Youtube Video and Channel Analytics.

## Average View Duration

**AVD** is how long the average viewer watches a video. There are cutoffs for mid-roll ads and the longer the **AVD** the more ads can be shown.

If a viewer watches just 30 seconds they may have been shown a pre-roll ad and that's it. If they watch 5 minutes they may have seen a pre-roll, a mid-roll, and an end-roll ad. Because **CPM** is calculated per each view, the more ads shown the higher the **CPM**.

## Audience

Not all ads priced the same. All Adsense (Google) ads are priced via an auction. Companies bid on ads shown to specific demographics. The more valuable the demographic the higher the cost to display to a specific audience.

A channels audience is the demographics of the viewers. If a Software Engineering channel like [t3â€¤gg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) creates a gaming video the audience is mainly high earners, so advertisers will pay more to show ads to that audience. The opposite is true, if a gaming channel creates a software engineering video the audience is mainly children, so advertisers will pay less to show ads to that audience.

## Content Topic

The content of a video is important to advertisers. If a video is about a specific product or service a company in that space may bid higher to show advertisements on that video. An example is a video about "how to fix a clogged toilet" may have ads from local plumbing companies.

**Audience** and **Content Topic** are similar, but the key difference is advertisers can target either demographics of the viewer OR the content of the video. Different channels and videos cater to these differently.

# The YouTube CPM equation

![CPM Equation](images/equation_cpm.svg)

## CPM

Earnings paid to a creator are calculated by `Views / 1000 * RPM` where **RPM** is the revenue per 1000 views. **CPM** is the cost per 1000 views to advertisers. `RPM + Google's Cut = CPM`. Both **RPM** and **CPM** are the visible in Youtube Video and Channel Analytics. [Google's Explanation](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9314357?hl=en)

## Average View Duration

**AVD** is how long the average viewer watches a video. Ads can be shown at the beginning and middle of videos. Viewers are more likely to be show a pre-roll ad if they haven't seen another ad recently and are more likely to be shown a mid-roll ad if they are watching for a longer period of time. The longer the **AVD** the more ads can be shown.

If a viewer watches just 30 seconds they may have been shown a pre-roll ad and that's it. If they watch 10 minutes they may have seen a pre-roll and a mid-roll ad. Because **CPM** is calculated per each view, the more ads shown the higher the **CPM**. This relationship between **AVD** and **CPM** is often confused when deciphering a channel's Youtube Analytics.

## Audience

Not all ads priced the same. Adsense (Google) ads are priced via an auction. Companies bid on ads shown to specific demographics. The more valuable the demographic the higher the cost to display to a specific audience.

A channels audience is the demographics of the viewers. If a Software Engineering channel like [t3â€¤gg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) creates a gaming video the audience is primarily high earners, so advertisers will pay more to show ads to that audience. The opposite is true, if a gaming channel creates a software engineering video the audience is mainly children, so advertisers will pay less to show ads to that audience.

The Audience a channel brings to a video is important to the earning potential of a video.

## Content Topic

The content of a video is important to advertisers. If a video is about a specific product or service a company in that space will bid higher to show advertisements on that video. An example is a video about "how to fix a clogged toilet" may have ads from local plumbing companies.

**Audience** and **Content Topic** are similar, but the key difference is advertisers can target either audience demographics OR the content of the video. Different channels and videos cater to these differently.

## CPM Equation

The calculation of at what rate a video earns is defined by other three variables. All other factors can be distilled idea into one of these three. Channels should focus on increasing these variables without sacrificing the others in order to increase their **CPM** and thus their **RPM**.

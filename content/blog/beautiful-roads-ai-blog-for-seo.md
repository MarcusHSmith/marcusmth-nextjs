# Why I created an AI blog for SEO

This week I launched a new blog called [Beautiful Roads](https://beautifulroads.fyi) that uses AI to generate content. It was inspired after I discovered [Dangerous Roads](https://dangerousroads.org) and how much traffic these search based blogs are receiving. Dangerous Roads was sending traffic to [People Watching](https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleWatchingMarcus) and I want to build a similar blog to send traffic to my YouTube channel.

# Building an SEO Network

Google's page rank algorithm is based on the links pointing to a page and specifically the value of those links. I have this blog [marcusmth.com](https://marcusmth.com), my YouTube channel [People Watching](https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleWatchingMarcus), and now Beautiful Roads. By linking these sites together, I can increase the value of each site and grow them together. _well at least that's the theory_

# AI Blogging

I'm using AI tools all day, whether through Github Copilot or ChatGPT Plus. Creating a blog that uses AI to generate content is the next step.

Each of these blog posts takes about 5 minutes to generate and publish using ChatGPT and Sanity studio.

# Results

We're still in the first week of this project, I'll update this post with the results in a few months. I'm hoping to see a significant increase in traffic to my YouTube channel and this blog.

For now this post is the first backlinks between my different projects. Thanks for reading to this point... _you're helping my bounce rate_

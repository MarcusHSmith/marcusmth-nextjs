Linear is a powerful project management tool that helps teams organize work through a clear hierarchical structure. Let's dive into how Linear organizes work from high-level planning down to individual tasks.

## Initiatives

Initiatives in Linear are high-level strategic objectives - these often map to company goals or OKRs.

- "Customer Experience Messaging Application"
- "Mobile App Launch"

Initiatives allow everyone to visualize progress towards company goals.

## Projects and Milestones

### Projects

Projects in Linear are collections of related issues that contribute to a specific deliverable or outcome. They're more focused and shorter-term than initiatives with a timeline. A project typically:

- Has a defined scope and timeline
- Contains multiple related issues
- Can be part of a larger initiative but does not have to be
- Includes progress tracking and completion status

### Milestones

Milestones are significant checkpoints or deadlines within projects. They help teams:

- Track major project phases
- Set clear delivery dates
- Measure progress against timeline
- Coordinate cross-team dependencies

## Issues and Sub-issues: Getting Things Done

### Issues

Issues are the fundamental unit of work in Linear. They represent specific tasks, bugs, features, or pieces of work that need to be completed. Each issue:

- Has a clear owner
- Contains detailed descriptions and requirements
- Can be prioritized and scheduled
- Tracks status and progress
- Can be linked to projects and initiatives

### Sub-issues

Sub-issues allow you to break down complex issues into smaller, manageable pieces. They're perfect for:

- Breaking large features into smaller tasks
- Creating checklists of requirements
- Managing dependencies within a larger issue
- Distributing work among team members

## Putting It All Together

Linear's organizational structure creates a clear hierarchy:

1. Initiatives (Strategic Goals)
   - Projects (Deliverables)
     - Issues (Tasks)
       - Sub-issues (Subtasks)

This structure helps teams:

- Maintain clear visibility from strategy to execution
- Track progress at every level
- Ensure all work contributes to larger goals
- Keep teams aligned and focused

By understanding and properly using these organizational elements, teams can better manage their work and achieve their objectives more efficiently.

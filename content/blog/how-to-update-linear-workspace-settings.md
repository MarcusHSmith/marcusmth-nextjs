Linear is a powerful project management tool that allows teams to customize their workspace settings for better organization and branding. In this guide, we'll walk through how to update two important settings: your team workspace name and issue URL format.

## Updating Your Team Workspace Name

1. Click on your workspace name in the top-left corner of Linear
2. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu
3. Navigate to "General" in the settings sidebar
4. Look for the "Team Name" field
5. Enter your desired team name
6. Click "Save" to apply the changes

Your new team name will be immediately reflected across your Linear workspace.

## Customizing Issue URL Format

The issue URL format determines how your Linear issue links will appear. Here's how to modify it:

1. Go to workspace settings (same as above)
2. Navigate to "General" settings
3. Find the "Issue URL Format" section
4. Choose your preferred format:
   - Default format: `TEAM-123`
   - Custom format: You can use your team's abbreviation, e.g., `DEV-123`
5. Save your changes

## Best Practices

- Keep the team name clear and recognizable
- Use consistent abbreviations for URL formats
- Inform your team members about the changes
- Update any documentation or bookmarks that reference the old URLs

## Impact of Changes

When you update these settings:

- All existing issues will maintain their numbering
- New issues will follow the updated format
- Existing URLs will continue to work
- Team members will see the new workspace name immediately

## Additional Tips

- You can preview how the new issue format will look before saving
- Consider your team's workflow when choosing an issue format
- Make sure the new team name aligns with your organization's naming conventions

Remember that these changes affect your entire team, so it's good practice to communicate updates to all team members beforehand.

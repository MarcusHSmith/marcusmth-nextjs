As a content creator always exploring new platforms, I recently had the opportunity to join MSN Partner Hub with my "People Watching" content ([view my MSN channel](https://www.msn.com/en-us/channel/source/People%20Watching/sr-vid-esgcjjh9rb4ib2m7uqenjijscjpxxfpp7wnxyaquvry2y8duyims)). Here's my experience and insights about this emerging platform for video creators.

## Getting Started with MSN Partner Hub

MSN Partner Hub is an invitation-only platform with a stringent application process. While getting accepted can be challenging, the exclusive nature of the platform makes it worthwhile for content creators who make it through their selective vetting process. The platform offers an interesting alternative to traditional video hosting platforms like YouTube, with its own unique characteristics and requirements. The content can be repurposed for other platforms, like YouTube.

## Audience relationship with the Creator

The majority of content on MSN is viewed from a news feed. While the audience can "Follow" a creator, it's not as prominent as it is on YouTube.

On the creator's channel page, once a video is watched, it's removed from the feed. This is different than YouTube where the video remains in the feed but at the bottom.

## Monetization and Performance

### CPM/RPM Ad Rates

Interestingly, while the overall earnings are currently modest, the CPM (Cost Per Mille) and RPM (Revenue Per Mille) rates are comparable to YouTube. This suggests potential for revenue growth as the platform matures. I've been in the program for a few months and will report back with more insights once I have enough data.

Currently, MSN earning are about 2% of my YouTube earnings. I'm curious to see how this grows as I get more involved with the platform.

Payments are on a similar monthly schedule to YouTube. Because the content is repurposed from YouTube, the only additional effort is re-rendering a shorter version of the videos.

### View Patterns

The viewing patterns on MSN are quite distinct:

- Strong initial performance in the first 24 hours
- Significant drop in views after the first day
- Different audience engagement compared to YouTube

This "flash flood" viewing pattern requires a different strategy compared to the more gradual view accumulation typically seen on YouTube.

## Platform Growth and Opportunities

The MSN Partner Hub appears to be in its early stages, which presents both challenges and opportunities:

1. Growing Interest: I've received multiple offers from publications looking to purchase my account to gain access to MSN Partner Hub
2. Platform Evolution: As a newer platform, there's potential for early adopters to establish strong positions
3. Content Strategy: The platform is built for news, so they limit uploads to 200mb and restrict 4K content.

## Tips for Content Creators

If you're considering joining MSN Partner Hub, here are some key takeaways from my experience:

1. Optimize for Short-Form: Prepare condensed versions of your content
2. Focus on the Now: Videos go big then die. So upload time sensitive content that's relevant to the current day.
3. Maintain Quality: Despite technical limitations, ensure your content meets platform standards.
4. MSN filters on profanity. My videos are recorded in public and I've had videos rejected for having "bad words" spoken by people in the background.
5. Regular Publishing: Consistent uploads help maintain visibility

## Looking Forward

While MSN Partner Hub is still evolving, it presents an interesting opportunity for content creators to diversify their distribution channels. The platform's unique viewing patterns and comparable monetization rates make it worth considering as part of a broader content strategy.

For creators with existing long-form content, the platform offers a way to repurpose content for a different audience, potentially reaching viewers who might not discover your content on traditional platforms.

I'll continue to experiment with the platform and update this post as I gather more insights about performance patterns and best practices.

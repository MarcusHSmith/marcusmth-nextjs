# Why My YouTube Shopping Links Haven't Made a Single Sale

_I've tagged cameras, microphones, and gear in my walking videos for more than six months. In that same period, I've earned thousands of dollars from YouTube ads. From Shopping? Not a single dollar. This post is a breakdown of why YouTube Shopping links don't convert — at least not on a channel like mine._

## Background: Ads vs. Shopping

On _People Watching_, I upload long, unedited walking tours. The channel has grown steadily, and the ad revenue has become meaningful. In fact, over the past six months, I've made several thousand dollars just from YouTube ads alone.

At the same time, I've been part of YouTube's Shopping affiliate program. For every video, I've tagged the equipment I actually use — cameras, microphones, stabilizers, tripods. The products are directly connected to how the videos are made, so it seemed like a natural fit. The hope was simple: viewers interested in the behind-the-scenes might click through, buy the gear, and I'd earn a small commission.

But six months in, the result is stark: **$0 from Shopping, thousands from ads.**

## Why Shopping Links Didn't Convert

### 1. Research Habits

Even when viewers are interested in a product, they usually don't buy it instantly after one video. YouTube shoppers often watch multiple videos, do additional research, and then make purchases on the big retail sites where they already shop — places like Amazon, Costco, or Best Buy. That means even if my video sparks curiosity, the final purchase almost always happens outside YouTube's affiliate ecosystem.

### 2. Comparison with TikTok Shop

TikTok Shop has shown far stronger results for creators because it operates differently. The platform is built around limited-time deals and discounts that you can't easily get elsewhere. That exclusivity creates urgency and incentives for instant checkout. YouTube, by contrast, isn't offering unique deals — it's just linking to the same products viewers can find cheaper or more conveniently somewhere else.

## Lessons Learned

Here are some alternatives I've discovered:

**1. Sell your own products** - Create merchandise, digital guides, or courses related to your content. You control pricing and build direct audience relationships.

**2. Link Amazon affiliates in the description** - Amazon's affiliate program has better reach than YouTube Shopping. Link to gear you actually use with clear disclosure.

**3. Find brands with creator-specific affiliate programs** - Partner with brands that offer custom affiliate programs for creators. These often have better rates and exclusive benefits.

For now, I'll keep tagging products. It takes little effort, and maybe one day the right video will click. But I won't expect Shopping to contribute meaningfully. For a channel like mine, ads remain the backbone of revenue, and that's okay.

## Next Experiments

- Try pinned comments with gear links to see if visibility matters.
- Add a brief on-screen or verbal mention ("Links to my camera and mic are below if you're curious").
- Test one video that intentionally leans into gear — almost a mini-review — to see if the context changes conversion.

If none of that works, I'll accept that _People Watching_ isn't a shopping channel. And that's fine. The ads prove the content has value — even if the Shopping links don't.

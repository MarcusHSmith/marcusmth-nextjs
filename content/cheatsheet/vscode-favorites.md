If I need to look up multiple times, I should just record it in my own cheatsheet.

`CMD + ALT + 0` split screen horizontally

`OPT + CMD + â†“` multiline editing

`CTR + -` go to previous cursor position

`CTR + SHIFT + -` go to next cursor position

`CMD + K, CMD + 0` collapse all sections in file

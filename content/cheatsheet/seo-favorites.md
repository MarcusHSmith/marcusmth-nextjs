## Backlinks

SEO rankings are heavily influenced by the number and quality of backlinks to your site. Apps like [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com) help track them. Sites with high volume have a large number of backlinks.

One sneaky way to get high value backlinks is to create links in [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org).

## Hypotheses

NFTs are read from chain and displayed on many websites across the internet. Including a link in the description or metadata will create multiple backlinks from different aggregators.

This NFT on Devnet of Solana tests that theory: ["testing backlinks"](https://dev.primitives.xyz/token/6aJ1cmVkHKPuBQ4mQULMX5)
